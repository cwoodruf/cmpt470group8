You can find the database schema in this directory
contacts/models/base/a3_cal.mysql

This project is a test / debug session for my final project frame work. 
There is a link to the framework docs. Most likely these pages will not 
validate (as they are mediawiki) and should not be considered part of 
the actual assignment. They are there to give an overview of how the code 
works.

Most of the "guts" of the application can be found in 
contacts/controllers/home.php 
and also
models/contacts.php
contains some of the custom sql functions used by the controller.
