<h1>Perl & Python Comparison</h1>
<p>
In general, Python and Perl are relatively similar to each other as programming languages which makes them suitable for similar applications. Both are general purpose scripting languages with an origin in UNIX shell scripting, suitable for application or web programming, and both start with the letter 'P'.
</p>
<p>
There are some noticable differences however. Python is vastly more readable than Perl is. Perl has quite a few unclear or unintuitive keywords such as bless, my, or die, and operators such as $, @, and %, that make it hard to decypher for those new to the language or for maintaining old code. However, this can result in compact code and flexibility in programming styles. In contrast, Python was designed to be readable, with few ambiguities. Whitespace replaced semicolons on statements and declarations and indentation replaced curly braces on programming blocks resulting in clutter-free scripts.
</p>
<p>
Perl has a speed advantage over Python in small programs especially in its built in pattern matching capabilities. Python however, is better for larger programs due to its Object-Oriented design for which on Perl was an improvised addition. One of the big advantages of Perl over Python is CPAN, its huge collection of modules, that contain modules that are still being maintained and updated. Python's libraries are however, more comprehensive and provide a larger group of related tools for the programmer than most individual Perl module. However to date, Python's collection of libraries is not nearly as sophisticated as CPAN in terms of size or support.
