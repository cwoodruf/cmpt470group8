This app is a simple book database. It uses the same database and templates as the catalyst example 
but does not implement a log in system. Anyone can add or delete books to the database. 
</p>
<p>
This demonstrates basic "Create Retrieve Update Delete" database operations using 
CGI::Application as the backbone and Template Toolkit as the templating engine.
