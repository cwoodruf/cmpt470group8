<h1>Perl and C for Dynamic Websites</h1>
<p>
At first glance one might think that the interpreted perl programming language and the compiled C
language would have mutually exclusive functions relative to serving web content. C would be the
language of choice for long running processes such as web server modules and perl the technology of
choice for the more transient task of parsing CGI input and generating dynamic content. However, in
reality there is considerable overlap between these two technologies.
</p>
<p>
For example, a compiled C program can substantially improve performance even for simple CGI
applications. And, with technologies, such as mod_perl it is possible to integrate perl into a web server
much the same way as one would a compiled C module. Nevertheless, in each case there are still trade
offs based on what each technology is best suited for.
</p>
<p>
C is particularly well suited to applications that might require complete integration into the web server
as most web servers are written in C. In the case of apache, if you want the best performance, you can
statically compile a C module into the web server program binary. This is not possible for an
interpreted language like perl. However, C is far less fault tolerant than perl. Seemingly innocuous
mistakes can cause the entire server to crash and memory leaks are potentially a problem. Using the
mod_perl module, on the other hand, you have access to the same server api as a C application but
perl's built in memory recovery and error handling facilities make it easier to produce a more stable
application with less work.
</p>
<p>
Perl and C are technologies that have a long association with web development and, given their
flexibility and the extensive code libraries available for each, will most likely continue to have a
significant role in web development for the foreseeable future.
