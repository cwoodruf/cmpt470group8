<h1>Perl vs ASP.NET Comparison</h1>
<p>
Perl is a scripting language native to Unix systems that has been around for approximately twenty-two years. Perl had its roots as a shell scripting language but found a niche as a web scripting and development language as well. A large developer community and an extensive set of web modules have allowed for Perl to remain relevant amongst many new and robust web technologies that provide similar functions. One of these other technologies is Microsoft’s ASP.NET. ASP.NET is part of Microsoft’s dot Net framework that gives ASP a highly integrated UI development platform that is lacking with Perl. Although there are other frameworks developed for Perl there is not a native, fully integrated and supported framework. In addition to this one of the most prominent differences between the two technologies is that Perl has been developed as an open source technology and has developers from all over the world working on it constantly. This differs completely from the closed source commercial software of ASP.NET. This difference is also significant because it means Perl is free compared to the hundreds or even thousands of dollars that may be spent of obtaining a dot NET platform to develop on. The Perl community has developed over 22,000 extension modules to be used with Perl, making it very functional and useful for many tasks. Another contrast deals with scripting for the purposes of system administrations, this is easily handled with Perl since this is where Perl’s roots lie. However ASP.NET is specifically web oriented and not intended for aiding in systems administration. Furthermore Perl, due to its open source nature, is easily compatible with all types of operating systems which is not the case for ASP.NET which is intended to run on windows based servers. This difference is significant considering that many internet service providers run Linux or Unix based web servers; making Perl more appealing in this sense. Perl’s versatility has allowed it to remain a viable web development tool alongside technologies such as ASP.NET.
