<h1>perl vs PHP as a web development platform</h1>

<p>One of the most obvious things one will notice when looking at the PHP and perl languages is the very similar syntax styles. Infact PHP was a web scripting language built with influences from perl and since PHP was built ground up as a web scripting language there are much more built in functionalities for making a web application. By default PHP can be integrated directly into a web page making it intuitive to beginners to jump right into programming. In the case of perl a third-party web platform is required for handling web requests then apache must be configured accordingly to the platform. Further more, unlike php web pages are developed in perl by writing scripts which then output a webpage. As much hassle as perl requires for beginning a web appication it gets worse when trying to find help on the web, where there is an enormous amount of documentation and topics on PHP, there is little on perl. On the other hand according to benchmarks, the performace of perl on fast-cgi or mod-perl is comparable to that of PHP as shown in our presentation slides. A big advantage of perl is the vast amount of purpose specific modules which can be beneficial for purpose driven web applications, and because perl is an older language there is better support for their mature modules. In summary for less experienced developers perl will have a steeper learning curve than PHP, but for more experienced developers it will come down to preference of languages since either languages are flexible enough to create advanced web applications.
