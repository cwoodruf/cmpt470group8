Notes:

The email logic is somewhat turned off. Normally, it would not be
the case that someone signing up would be able to log in right off the
bat. Rather volunteers have to click on an email confirmation link and
organizations need to be vetted by an admin. 

The problem is that mail from mx8 is being selectively rejected by 
some domains - most notably the sfu.ca domain.
Mail is known to work to gmail.com.

As a result new signups work right off the bat. You can click the Log in
link to access your organization or volunteer account.

By default the mail server is set up to send any unknown email to mx8 to
cwoodruf@gmail.com so if you try and send email to a random organization
that cwoodruf@gmail.com should receive it. You should also get a copy 
yourself if the mail isn't rejected en-route.

We have two versions of our site. The /v1/ is a version done by other
group members and reflects their work. It was not finished enough for us
to provide it as a final implementation. However, the group members involved
should be credited for their work. The /v2/ version is a more complete 
version but reflects - inaccurately - the involvement of the group members.
Most significantly the database design is by David Zhou and the overall 
look and feel of the site is by Vik Kumar.

Vik is the author of the User Guide.
