There are two source files: 

atomical.cgi - perl script that does parsing and display
atomical.css - css file to go with atomical.cgi

The code works by sniffing out the entries first and then grabbing anything 
else between, before or after articles to be searched for relevant metadata.
The entries are processed via a series of tag / callback pairs. We only look 
for what we are interested in and ignore anything else. The metadata is 
processed in the same way as are author fields (which have multiple tags).

I have tested this with a couple of urls:
http://localhost/~group8/a2/feed.xml (google news)
http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CC/470/ggbaker/assign/a2-sample.xml
http://news.google.com/news?ned=us&hl=en&topic=h&output=atom
http://kjdragon.smugmug.com/hack/feed.mg?Type=nickname&Data=kjdragon&format=atom10
http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CC/470/ggbaker/assign/a2-samples/1.xml
http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CC/470/ggbaker/assign/a2-samples/2.xml

Its quite difficult to find atom feeds let alone ones in foreign script - having an
example to test would have helped. 

I did check the plain form for css and html errors.

Cheers

Cal
